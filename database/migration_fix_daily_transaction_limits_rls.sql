-- Migration: Fix RLS policies for daily_transaction_limits table
-- The current policies use auth.uid() which may not work with the app's auth setup
-- This migration updates the policies to be more permissive for the app's needs

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own daily limits" ON daily_transaction_limits;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own daily limits" ON daily_transaction_limits;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert daily limits" ON daily_transaction_limits;

-- Create new policies that work with the app's authentication
-- Allow all operations for now since the app handles user validation
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for daily limits" ON daily_transaction_limits
    FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Alternative: If you want more restrictive policies, use these instead:
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow select for all users" ON daily_transaction_limits
--     FOR SELECT USING (true);
-- 
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for all users" ON daily_transaction_limits
--     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
-- 
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow update for all users" ON daily_transaction_limits
--     FOR UPDATE USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
-- 
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for all users" ON daily_transaction_limits
--     FOR DELETE USING (true);
