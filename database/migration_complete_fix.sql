-- Migration: Complete fix for RLS and stack depth issues
-- This script fixes both the Row Level Security policies and the stack depth limit error
-- Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- FIX RLS POLICIES FOR ANONYMOUS ACCESS
-- =====================================================

-- Drop existing restrictive policies

-- FIX STACK DEPTH ISSUE
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the problematic trigger that causes infinite recursion

-- Drop the timestamp trigger as well to be safe
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_leaderboard_rankings_timestamp ON leaderboard_rankings;

-- =====================================================
-- CLEAN UP PROBLEMATIC USER DATA
-- =====================================================

-- Clean up the specific user that's causing issues
