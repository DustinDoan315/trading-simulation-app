# TestFlight Crash Fix - Implementation Guide

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your TestFlight app was crashing due to **missing Supabase environment variables** in the EAS build configuration. The app was trying to initialize Supabase during startup, but the required credentials were not available, causing an immediate crash.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Updated EAS Configuration** (`eas.json`)

- Added missing Supabase environment variables to all build profiles:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Used actual Supabase credentials from your `.env` file

### 2. **Improved Error Handling** (`services/SupabaseService.ts`)

- Added graceful error handling for missing Supabase configuration
- App will now log warnings instead of crashing when Supabase is unavailable
- Added null checks to prevent TypeScript errors

### 3. **Created Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy-testflight.js`)

- Automated deployment process for TestFlight
- Validates environment variables before building
- Handles build and submission in one command

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the deployment script
yarn deploy-testflight
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the app
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Submit to TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios --profile preview
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

1. ✅ **EAS CLI is installed**: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli`
2. ✅ **Logged into EAS**: `eas login`
3. ✅ **Supabase credentials are correct** in `eas.json`
4. ✅ **Apple Developer account** is properly configured
5. ✅ **App Store Connect** has the correct app ID

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Environment Variables Added

```json
{
  "env": {
    "EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "https://qmiafrudmawctuazhluz.supabase.co",
    "EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  }
}
```

### Files Modified

- `eas.json` - Added Supabase environment variables
- `services/SupabaseService.ts` - Improved error handling
- `scripts/deploy-testflight.js` - New deployment script
- `package.json` - Added deployment script command

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After deployment:

1. **Wait for Apple processing** (10-30 minutes)
2. **Download from TestFlight** on your device
3. **Test app launch** - should no longer crash
4. **Test core functionality** - trading, portfolio, etc.
5. **Check logs** if issues persist

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If App Still Crashes:

1. **Check device logs** in Xcode Console
2. **Verify Supabase credentials** are correct
3. **Ensure Supabase database** is accessible
4. **Check network connectivity** on device

### Common Issues:

- **Build fails**: Check EAS CLI version and login status
- **Submission fails**: Verify Apple Developer account setup
- **App crashes**: Check Supabase database permissions

## 📞 Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check the device logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify your Supabase project** is active and accessible
3. **Test with a development build** first: `eas build --platform ios --profile development`

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After implementing these fixes:

- ✅ App launches without crashing
- ✅ Supabase connection works properly
- ✅ All trading features function normally
- ✅ Data sync between local and cloud works

---

**Note**: The Supabase credentials in this configuration are from your existing `.env` file. Make sure these are the correct production credentials for your TestFlight build.
